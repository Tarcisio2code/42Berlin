## 📖 Overview
This repository contains the solutions for the C++ modules from the 42 School curriculum. The series is designed to take a programmer from C to C++ (Object-Oriented Programming) by exploring memory management, polymorphism, and template metaprogramming.

## 🛠️ Key Technical Skills
🧱 Foundational OOP (CPP 00 - CPP 01)
- **Encapsulation**: Designing classes with private attributes and public interfaces (Getters/Setters).

- **Memory Management**: Mastering the stack vs. heap allocation using new and delete.

- **Resource Management**: Understanding the lifecycle of objects (Constructors and Destructors).

- **References & Pointers**: Knowing when to use each to optimize memory and performance.

📐 Data Integrity & Overloading (CPP 02)
- **Ad-hoc Polymorphism**: Implementing Operator Overloading (arithmetic, comparison, and assignment).

- **Fixed-point Arithmetic**: Understanding non-floating-point representations for precision.

- **Orthodox Canonical Form**: Ensuring classes are robust by implementing Default Constructor, Copy Constructor, Copy Assignment Operator, and Destructor.

🌳 Inheritance & Hierarchy (CPP 03)
- **Class Extension**: Reusing code through public inheritance.

- **Construction Order**: Understanding how the compiler builds objects from the base class up to the derived class.

- **Member Shadowing**: Managing attribute and method visibility across the inheritance chain.

🎭 Advanced Polymorphism (CPP 04)
- **Subtype Polymorphism**: Using virtual functions to achieve dynamic dispatch and runtime behavior.

- **Deep vs. Shallow Copy**: Preventing memory corruption by manually duplicating dynamically allocated resources (e.g., the Brain component).

- **Abstract Classes (Interfaces)**: Implementing Pure Virtual Functions to define strict behavioral contracts for derived classes.
